You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

This day, the allure of the unknown proved too strong to resist.\n\nAs a delivery truck pulled away, leaving a gap in the alley's metal gate, Bartholomew saw his chance. With a silent, practiced leap, he was on the other side, the scent of freedom sharp in his nostrils.\n\nThe world was a symphony of smells and sights: damp asphalt, pungent exhaust fumes, the tang of spices from a nearby bakery. He followed the scent of fish, a lure he couldn't resist, leading him to a bustling market. He darted between legs, dodging baskets of produce, his tail twitching with excitement. \n\nHe found himself face-to-face with a ginger cat, its fur matted, eyes wary. Bartholomew, always a friendly soul, purred a greeting, offering a playful swipe with his paw. The ginger cat, initially hesitant, responded with a hesitant lick and a soft meow. He introduced himself as Jasper, a seasoned street cat, and offered to show Bartholomew the ropes.\n\nTogether, they explored the city's hidden corners, navigating rooftops, scaling fire escapes, and squeezing through impossibly small spaces. Bartholomew, with his boundless energy, quickly learned to climb, to scavenge, and to navigate the complex social hierarchy of alleyway life. He even learned a few tricks from Jasper, like how to steal a delicious chicken drumstick from a careless vendor.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows on the buildings, Bartholomew felt a pang of longing for home. He’d had his adventure, experienced the thrill of freedom, but he missed his cozy bed and the familiar scent of his human. \n\nHe met Jasper at their usual meeting spot, a discarded cardboard box near the bakery. Jasper, with a knowing glint in his eye, nodded towards the alley gate. Bartholomew, with a purr of thanks, slipped through the gap, the familiar scent of his apartment welcoming him back. \n\nThat night, curled up on his favorite cushion, Bartholomew dreamt of his adventures, a contented purr rumbling in his chest. He’d tasted freedom, but he knew, with a newfound certainty, that his true home was with his human, surrounded by the love and comfort he’d never take for granted. And though he would always be a cat of adventure, Bartholomew knew that the greatest adventures were often the ones we shared, in the comfort of our own homes. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

It allows for using different themes or even creating your own custom theme.\n\n* **Integrate with virtual environments:** The script can display information about your currently active virtual environment (e.g., Python's `virtualenv`, Node.js's `nvm`, or Conda environments) in the prompt.\n\nIn short, it improves the user experience when working with Git by providing immediate and visually appealing feedback about your repository's state directly in your terminal.
